## ✨ Key Features

- **Secure Authentication:** Users can create accounts and log in securely via Firebase Auth.

- **Real-Time Notifications:** A dedicated notification hub allows users to manage incoming requests (Approve/Deny) and track their own outgoing requests.
- **Full Profile Control:** Donors have the power to **Edit** their information at any time or **Delete** their profile if they are no longer available.
- **Medical Accuracy:** Mandatory blood type selection for all donors (Blood and Organ) to ensure medical compatibility.
- **Responsive Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS, the platform is fully optimized for both Desktop and Mobile devices.
